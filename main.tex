\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

% This paper presents the development of a Hadoop MapReduce module that has been taught in a course in distributed computing to upper undergraduate computer science students at Clemson University. The paper describes our teaching experiences and the feedback from the students over several semesters that have helped to shape the course. We provide suggested best practices for lecture materials, the computing platform, and the teaching methods. In addition, the computing platform and teaching methods can be extended to accommodate emerging technologies and modules for related courses.
